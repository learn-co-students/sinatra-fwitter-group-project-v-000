-Need logic to limit the type of username
-Check if username/email exists at sign up
-password specs?
-more useful error message for failed sign up

-for verifying account, is it better to have logic in controller or in view??? Ex:Sinatra Sessions Lab- User Logins uses helpers and puts logic in view- maybe necessary if someone tried to directly navigate to url
