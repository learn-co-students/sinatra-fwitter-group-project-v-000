# Fwitter Group Project

## Objectives

Built a full scale Sinatra application that uses:

+ A sqlite database
+ ActiveRecord
+ RESTful routes
+ Sessions
+ Login/Logout

## Overview

Built a simple MVC Twitter clone with <a href="https://github.com/jackexyou">@jackexyou</a> using Sinatra and ActiveRecord. Users can Log In, Log Out, view/edit/delete their own tweets, and view the tweets of others. Very barebones with a focus on basic functionality and wrapping our heads around Sinatra, rather than style. 

## To Improve 

+ Add a flash error message when blank passwords or tweets are entered.
+ Add a general template with a menu and Log Out link on every page.
+ Redirect to Tweets feed when logged in and accessing the home route.
+ Add styling.
