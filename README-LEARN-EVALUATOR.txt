Hi there,

I take full responsibility for the fact that this project is full of spaghetti code, the pages are ugly and unstyled, and some routes may be broken. 
I'm not used to labs that are going to be evaluated by human eyes having rspec tests. 
I thought this was just going to be a regular lab where you pass all the tests and then submit. I didn't realize it would be evaluated.
I was just eager to move on to the Sinatra final project, as I'm far behind my personal timeline for Flatiron.

Please let me know what needs to be fixed and I'll be happy to do it including, but not limited to:
- universal nav bar
- better navigation
- better separation of concerns
- more precise commenting

Thank you,
Justin R. Acker
