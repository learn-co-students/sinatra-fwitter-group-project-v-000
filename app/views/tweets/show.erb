Coming Soon:

Tweet show page

(note: add a link to edit)
(note: add a FORM to delete - just a submit button, no input fields. patch line?)

The form to delete a tweet should be submitted via a POST request to tweets/:id/delete.

give your form tag a method of "post" and an action of "/posts/:id/delete'. Make sure to dynamically set the :id of the form action! You'll also need to make sure the form includes the hidden input tag to change the request from post to delete
